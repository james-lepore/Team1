						<div class="arrow" id="arrow7"></div>
					</div>
					<div class='answer' id='answer7'>
						First, welcome to the future, traveler. Over the past thousand years, inflation has exponentially risen to an absurdly high level and all physical money has been replaced by our new cryptocurrency, Standard Herc Currency (SHC). If you would like to convert your physical money to the grossly overinflated SHC, use the converter below.

						Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement) in the course of developing the thought experiment.
