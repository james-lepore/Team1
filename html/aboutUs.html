            <img src="../images/james.jpg"/>
            James was the first and only human to survive uploading his consciousness to the mainframe of a time machine. Now, half-man, half-machine, James uses his unbridled power over time and space for the most noble of pursuits: making advertising websites for dictators.

            <img src="../images/Michael Binks.jpg"/>
            Michael is a failed Sith lord and dictator of the world, with his many plans going awry due to his lack of leadership skills and competence. He first had his invasion of the planet Hoth, where, under the guidance of Napoleon, invaded an ice planet during its winter, it didn’t go well. Then he went to Tatooine but sadly had to leave very early due to his newly discovered allergy to sand. Then he went to Alderaan, which was his final chance to achieve his evil goals, but sadly for him Alderaan had already blown up before he got there, oops! In his misery, Michael decided to just get a standard desk job as a Computer Programmer.
